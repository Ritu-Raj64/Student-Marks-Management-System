## ✨ Features

- Takes input for multiple students  
- Calculates total marks and percentage  
- Displays a formatted marksheet  
- Finds and shows the **topper of the class**  
- Uses `getline()` for better name input (supports full names)

---

## 📘 Concepts Used

- Class and Object  
- Array of Objects  
- Encapsulation (using private data members)  
- Functions inside class (input, display, topper)  
- Basic Control Structures and Loops  
- Percentage Calculation and Comparison Logic  


## 🚀 How to Run

### 1️⃣ Compile the Program
```bash
g++ student_topper.cpp -o topper
./topper

💡 Example Output
==== Enter student details: ====

Student 1
Enter Name: Ritu Raaz
Enter Roll No: 101
Enter Marks for 5 subjects: 
C++ , Stats , Maths , R Programming , FA = 88 79 92 85 90

Student 2
Enter Name: Ankit Sharma
Enter Roll No: 102
Enter Marks for 5 subjects: 
C++ , Stats , Maths , R Programming , FA = 82 75 95 84 87

==== Student Marksheet ====

No   Name         Roll.no   C++  Stats  Maths  R Pro  FA  Percentage
1    Ritu Raaz    101       88   79     92     85     90   86.8%
2    Ankit Sharma 102       82   75     95     84     87   84.6%

==== Topper of the Class ====
Name = Ritu Raaz  
Roll No = 101  
Percentage = 86.8%
```
## 🔧 Future Improvements

- Add support for more subjects dynamically
- File handling to store and load data
- GUI interface using **Qt or Tkinter (Python integration)**
- Display subject-wise topper
